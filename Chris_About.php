                    Why did we create Unexpected Disasters? <hr>
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Natural disasters like bushfires, floods, cyclones, drought and other traumatic ‘natural’ events are extremely challenging for the people directly affected. The stress caused following a natural disaster can lead to ‘burnout’ and physical, mental and emotional exhaustion. Some people will be able to manage the stress but for others it may be difficult to cope. Most people eventually heal and recover and go on to rebuild their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the power of social media mechanics we bring to you The Unexpected Disasters a platform where the public can empower themselves by reporting and sharing information about local disasters. Lend support to your piers or take advantage of our extensive help section, no matter the disaster we will be there to help you.
